To convert a decimal number to binary code, you can follow these steps:

1. Divide the decimal number by 2.
2. Write down the integer result (0 or 1).
3. Write the remainder (0 or 1) on the right side.
4. Divide the integer result again by 2.
5. Write down the new integer result (0 or 1) to the left of the previous remainder.
